# Project scope

External stakeholder: LaggIT, the E-Sports and LAN association of the IT student division of Chalmers.

The product is a service that helps create, organise and manage E-Sport tournaments. It manages brackets, registration of teams, scheduling, tournament information and communication. The target demographic for this application is tournament organisers and players.

The organiser creates a tournament by entering the name, the maximum number of players, the tournament dates, setting times for matches to be played and a description of the tournament.

The teams register to the tournament via a registration form. When the tournament is full or the sign up closes the service generates a bracket which contains all the matches to be played.

There is an individual page for every match where you can see when the match is scheduled, which teams are playing and where the players can report the score of the match after it is played.

The organiser has access to administrative tools. The organiser can reschedule when matches should be played, set scores for matches and edit scores if necessary.

The cost to develop this application is only development time. Income could be generated by advertisement and collaborations with other companies.
