# Individual Carl Holmberg Week 1

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to better understand how react works. I have mostly coded on the backend but i want to get some experience writing frontend code. I want to better understand my role as scrum master and continue inspiring our group to continue following an agile workflow.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have learned how the backend and the graphql bridge works so I can teach the group members that did more frontend how the backend works. I also continue helping our scrum process with some of my experience from work before this course, which could be valueable when improving our workflow.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I became scrum master. My role is to inspire the usage of scrum and solve some issues that might be blocking progress. I have also suggested changes in our social contract. Because of the current situation with corona we cannot have a rule where if you are late you have to bring fika. I suggested that if you are late, we pitch in money that we can use for some activity when we can meet.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have written the database entities and the graphql objects. I have also written most of the graphql resolvers. This is almost exclusively backend code.
