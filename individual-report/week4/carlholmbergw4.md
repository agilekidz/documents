# Individual Carl Holmberg Week 3
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn to use react to write frontends and the methods we have chosen to structure the frontend of the application. I did not have a chance to learn this during this sprint. I also want to better understand how to break up user-stories into tasks because this sprint the tasks went into eachother and were small so this sprint I want to learn to break up tasks into a good size and more create more vertical tasks.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I know how to use docker solve some of the recurring problems with our development environment so I can help people with those when they come up. I am still know some stuff about the backend so I can probably help people wanting to develop in the backend. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We decided to remove the roll of scrum master because we deemed it unnecessary for our project. I participated in the planning meeting and gave some input. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This was a weird week. I was busy during the first part of the week where the rest of the group did lots of work. There were almost no work left for me to do so I picked the last remaining card and started working on it. Then some other people rewrote the solution to this task, because they said that they should do it but had not assigned themself in trello. There was a missunderstanding and my code was not used, so I did not actually produce anything this week.
