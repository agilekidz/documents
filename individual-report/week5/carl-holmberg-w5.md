# Individual Carl Holmberg Week 5
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to become better at streamlining a meeting. Our sprint planning meeting was very long and we did not even discuss enough tasks to fill the sprint. I also want to learn to better estimate how many userstories we can finish in one sprint. We picked to few userstories this sprint. I want to continue learning typescript and react.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can do my best to learn some technical stuff so that I can be of better help when I program with someone else. I can continue helping people with backend code.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I participated in the meetings and did my best in helping to design the new and improved userstories. I helped with writing this weeks team reflection. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I learned how to write frontend. I wrote the match screen togheter with Rasmus. It was very fun. We severly underestimated the number of userstories we would be could finish in one sprint, so this was the only task left when I started coding. I was busy during monday and tuesday. I did not have any task left to work on after this one.
