# Individual Carl Holmberg Week 6
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to better understand why we made some of the descisions that we made early in the project. 
I want to better understand what can be done in the case that the tasks run out. 
We discussed slack tasks. 
It feels like a waste if you underestimate that some people should just sit of time.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can try to prepare for the coming report so that I can be of use when are going to write.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I was on the meeting and gave input on our plans to impove the length of our sprint planning meetings.
It was a lot more effective this week.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week we tried to plan beforehand when we should code. 
This led to me getting a lot done. 
I wrote code together with Aaron and some with Rasmus.
We got a lot done and completed some tasks that hadnt been completed the previous sprint.
A really productive week.
