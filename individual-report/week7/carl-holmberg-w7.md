# Individual Carl Holmberg Week 7

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to better understand how to structure a reflection as large as the final report.
I want to learn how to make the reflection effective and efficient.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I will try to write down my ideas so that I remember them to the reflection sessions.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I was on the meeting and gave input and participated.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I wrote the progression system, where when a match is finalized the winner is moved to the next match.
I helped do some redesign of some forms.
